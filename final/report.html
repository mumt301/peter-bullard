            <h3>MUMT301 Final Project Report - Peter Bullard</h3>
            <p>
                I created a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to order a playlist based on a chosen feature. 
                The page consists of a brief explanation of how to use it, a list of radio buttons to select the sorting feature,
                and a collection of text inputs to accept track names and, optionally, artist names. My intial plan was to use
                the MusicBrainz API to find the MusicBrainz ID number (MBID) of each track. The AcousticBrainz API could then
                compare two songs based on the chosen metric, and I would use that to order the playlist by starting with the first
                track entered and repeatedly adding the next "most similar" track. However, this was impossible since the
                AcousticBrainz API was discontinued in 2022. I tried to use the newer ListenBrainz API, but it does not have anything
                comparable to AcousticBrainz's "similarity" feature. Instead, I chose to work with Spotify's Web API (which I will
                refer to as "the API").
            </p>
            <p>
                The tracks are ordered using the following steps each time the page loads. After a request is sent to the API for a
                token, a URL is prepared for each song entered by the user. These URLs are used in calls to the API's search endpoint to get general
                information (Spotify ID number, artist, etc.) for each track. This information is stored in an array to later retrieve 
                and display. The ID numbers are used to call the API's audio-features endpoint
                for infomation about the tempo, loudness, etc. of the tracks. Each track is an element in a new array, containing
                information about those featuers. That array is then sorted according to the chosen feature, and a table is created
                to display the results. The ID of each track in the ordered array is found in the original array from the search, which
                is used to retrieve and display the corresponding track title and artist. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I found Spotify's Web API to be difficult to work with during this project. Aside from the initial struggle of learning
                how to properly get tokens and format the calls to the API, the results seemed to change when I opened the page on a new day.
                The greatest example of this occurred near the end of the project. On 18 December 2023, the sorting was functional, and I
                only had to create the table to finish the project. However, upon double-checking my results on 21 December 2023, I found that,
                unlike before, specifying an artist caused the API's search to only return a specific song by Kid Loco. I even had an old tab
                open from the 18th to verify that the same exact API calls were made and no code was changed, yet I was no longer getting the correct tracks from the search.
                The issue was only a missing space in my URLs before the artist name. This took hours to find because the same exact URLs
                worked just days prior, so I searched for problems elsewhere in my code after checking that the URLs were identical.
